# BMM Workflow

Use this when the task needs requirement discovery, change framing, and implementation.

Read `project-context.md` first for repository reality, command surface, and stable workspace boundaries.

## Internal Docs To Load

BMM uses the same internal support layer as Quick:

- `.codex/core/harness.md`
- `.codex/core/task-sizing.md`
- `.codex/core/milestone-design.md`
- `.codex/core/work-breakdown.md`
- `.codex/core/validation-matrix.md`
- `.codex/core/closeout-loop.md`
- `.codex/core/executable-guardrails.md`
- `.codex/core/persona-review.md`
- `.codex/core/adr-rules.md`
- `.codex/core/observability.md`
- `.codex/core/openspec-sync.md`
- `.codex/core/maturity-checklist.md`

Optional scaffolds:

- `.codex/templates/bmm-spec-checklist.md`
- `.codex/templates/change-record/README.md`
- `.codex/templates/change-record/proposal.md`
- `.codex/templates/change-record/design.md`
- `.codex/templates/change-record/tasks.md`
- `.codex/templates/change-record/durable-spec.md`
- `.codex/templates/milestone.md`
- `.codex/templates/milestone-status.md`
- `.codex/templates/closeout.md`

Also load the relevant repo maps from `docs/system-maps/` for the touched system areas. If a needed map is missing, inspect the code directly and create or update the map as part of the change when useful.

## Objective

Take a change from problem framing through implementation without exposing extra workflow concepts to the user.

The user still sees one mode: `BMM`.

Inside the workflow, however, the work must still be decomposed. BMM is feature-through-milestone delivery, not one branch-sized task.

## Change Record Convention

Prefer a change record under:

`openspec/changes/{change-name}/`

Use `kebab-case` for `{change-name}`.

Recommended minimum files for non-trivial work:

- `README.md`
- `proposal.md`
- `tasks.md`

Add `design.md` when the task changes architecture, shared contracts, or non-obvious technical behavior.

If the work already lives under `_bmad-output/changes/{change-name}/`, keep that record coherent instead of splitting the source of truth.

When creating a new change record, prefer this template flow:

1. use `.codex/templates/bmm-spec-checklist.md` to frame the whole change
2. use `.codex/templates/change-record/` starter files to write the first draft of `README.md`, `proposal.md`, `design.md`, `tasks.md`, and the durable contract spec
3. then tailor the files to the actual problem, validation package, ADR content, and milestone plan

## Working Sequence

1. Inspect the current code, docs, and any existing change artifacts before designing anything.
2. Define the problem, non-goals, scope, acceptance criteria, and success criteria.
3. Draft the change record using `.codex/templates/bmm-spec-checklist.md` plus the starter files under `.codex/templates/change-record/`.
4. Declare the validation package up front using `.codex/core/validation-matrix.md`.
5. Break the work into feature intent and milestone execution slices using `.codex/core/work-breakdown.md`.
6. Design each milestone with `.codex/core/milestone-design.md`, including entry context, acceptance criteria, validation package, fallback notes, and follow-on dependency before implementation starts.
7. Record those milestones in the active change record rather than leaving them implicit in chat reasoning.
8. Implement one milestone at a time with the same code, guardrail, observability, and doc discipline used by `Quick`.
9. Use `.codex/core/adr-rules.md` whenever the change records a durable architecture or workflow decision.
10. Use `.codex/core/persona-review.md` before closing a substantial milestone.
11. Sync milestone progress and validation state using `.codex/core/openspec-sync.md`.
12. Use `.codex/core/maturity-checklist.md` when refining the workflow itself or evaluating repeated delivery pain points.
13. Finish with `.codex/workflows/validate.md`, and use `.codex/workflows/archive.md` when the record should be formally closed out.

## BMM Still Has To Ship

BMM is not a documentation-only mode.

The output is not complete until:

- the code is implemented or explicitly deferred
- the declared validations are run or any gaps are called out
- the change record matches reality
- milestone status and residual risk are current
