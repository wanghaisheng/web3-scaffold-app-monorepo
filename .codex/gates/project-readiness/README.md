# Project Readiness Gate Pack

This pack defines the machine-checkable readiness packet used for non-trivial work packaging.

It exists to convert the guidance in `.codex/core/task-packaging.md` and `.codex/core/milestone-design.md` into a reusable gate with:

- packet contracts
- target manifests
- review/merge policy
- deterministic reporting
- waiver support for temporary exceptions

The repository does not currently expose a wired root readiness command. Treat this pack as a policy asset, not an active executable guarantee.
