3. **Difficulty Assessment**: Evaluates competition level and ranking difficulty

```

## Data Sources

> See [CONNECTORS.md](../../CONNECTORS.md) for tool category placeholders.

**With ~~SEO tool + ~~search console connected:**
Automatically pull historical search volume data, keyword difficulty scores, SERP analysis, current rankings from ~~search console, and competitor keyword overlap. The skill will fetch seed keyword metrics, related keyword suggestions, and search trend data.

**With manual data only:**
Ask the user to provide:
1. Seed keywords or topic description
2. Target audience and geographic location
3. Business goals (traffic, leads, sales)
4. Current domain authority (if known) or site age
5. Any known keyword performance data or search volume estimates

Proceed with the full analysis using provided data. Note in the output which metrics are from automated collection vs. user-provided data.

## Instructions

When a user requests keyword research:

1. **Understand the Context**

   Ask clarifying questions if not provided:
   - What is your product/service/topic?
   - Who is your target audience?
   - What is your business goal? (traffic, leads, sales)
   - What is your current domain authority? (new site, established, etc.)
   - Any specific geographic targeting?
   - Preferred language?

2. **Generate Seed Keywords**

   Start with:
   - Core product/service terms
   - Problem-focused keywords (what issues do you solve?)
   - Solution-focused keywords (how do you help?)
   - Audience-specific terms
   - Industry terminology

3. **Expand Keyword List**

   For each seed keyword, generate variations:
   
   ```markdown
   ## Keyword Expansion Patterns
   
   ### Modifiers
   - Best [keyword]
   - Top [keyword]
   - [keyword] for [audience]
   - [keyword] near me
   - [keyword] [year]
   - How to [keyword]
   - What is [keyword]
   - [keyword] vs [alternative]
   - [keyword] examples
   - [keyword] tools
   
   ### Long-tail Variations
   - [keyword] for beginners
   - [keyword] for small business
   - Free [keyword]
   - [keyword] software/tool/service
   - [keyword] template
   - [keyword] checklist
   - [keyword] guide
   ```

4. **Classify Search Intent**

   Categorize each keyword:

   | Intent | Signals | Example | Content Type |
   |--------|---------|---------|--------------|
   | Informational | what, how, why, guide, learn | "what is SEO" | Blog posts, guides |
   | Navigational | brand names, specific sites | "google analytics login" | Homepage, product pages |
   | Commercial | best, review, vs, compare | "best SEO tools [current year]" | Comparison posts, reviews |
   | Transactional | buy, price, discount, order | "buy SEO software" | Product pages, pricing |

5. **Assess Keyword Difficulty**

   Score each keyword (1-100 scale):

   ```markdown
   ### Difficulty Factors
   
   **High Difficulty (70-100)**
   - Major brands ranking
   - High domain authority competitors
   - Established content (1000+ backlinks)
   - Paid ads dominating SERP
   
   **Medium Difficulty (40-69)**
   - Mix of authority and niche sites
   - Some opportunities for quality content
   - Moderate backlink requirements
   
   **Low Difficulty (1-39)**
   - Few authoritative competitors
   - Thin or outdated content ranking
   - Long-tail variations
   - New or emerging topics
   ```

6. **Calculate Opportunity Score**

   Formula: `Opportunity = (Volume × Intent Value) / Difficulty`

   **Intent Value** assigns a numeric weight by search intent:
   - Informational = 1
   - Navigational = 1
   - Commercial = 2
   - Transactional = 3

   ```markdown
   ### Opportunity Matrix
   
   | Scenario | Volume | Difficulty | Intent | Priority |
   |----------|--------|------------|--------|----------|
   | Quick Win | Low-Med | Low | High | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Growth | High | Medium | High | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Long-term | High | High | High | ⭐⭐⭐ |
   | Research | Low | Low | Low | ⭐⭐ |
   ```

7. **Identify GEO Opportunities**

   Keywords likely to trigger AI responses:
   
   ```markdown
   ### GEO-Relevant Keywords
   
   **High GEO Potential**
   - Question formats: "What is...", "How does...", "Why is..."
   - Definition queries: "[term] meaning", "[term] definition"
   - Comparison queries: "[A] vs [B]", "difference between..."
   - List queries: "best [category]", "top [number] [items]"
   - How-to queries: "how to [action]", "steps to [goal]"
   
   **AI Answer Indicators**
   - Query is factual/definitional
   - Answer can be summarized concisely
   - Topic is well-documented online
   - Low commercial intent
   ```

8. **Create Topic Clusters**

   Group keywords into content clusters:

   ```markdown
   ## Topic Cluster: [Main Topic]
   
   **Pillar Content**: [Primary keyword]
   - Search volume: [X]
   - Difficulty: [X]
   - Content type: Comprehensive guide
   
   **Cluster Content**:
   
   ### Sub-topic 1: [Secondary keyword]
   - Volume: [X]
   - Difficulty: [X]
   - Links to: Pillar
   - Content type: [Blog post/Tutorial/etc.]
   
   ### Sub-topic 2: [Secondary keyword]
   - Volume: [X]
   - Difficulty: [X]
   - Links to: Pillar + Sub-topic 1
   - Content type: [Blog post/Tutorial/etc.]
   
   [Continue for all cluster keywords...]
   ```

9. **Generate Output Report**

   ```markdown
   # Keyword Research Report: [Topic]
   
   **Generated**: [Date]
   **Target Audience**: [Audience]
   **Business Goal**: [Goal]

              │     └──────────────┘
              │     ┌──────────────┐
┌─────────┐   ├─────│  Sub-topic B  │

### Topic Cluster Planning Template

| Pillar Topic | Pillar Keyword | Cluster Topic | Cluster Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Status |
|-------------|---------------|--------------|----------------|--------|-----------|--------|
| [Broad topic] | [Head keyword] | [Subtopic 1] | [Long-tail 1] | [X] | [X] | [Draft/Published] |

## Keyword Prioritization Framework

**Which score to use**: Use the Priority Score (below) for initial keyword triage and shortlisting. Use the Opportunity Score (Step 6 above) for final content calendar prioritization, where the additional GEO and competitive factors provide more nuanced ranking.

### Priority Scoring Matrix

Score each keyword 1-5 on these factors, then calculate weighted total:

| Factor | Weight | Score 1 (Low) | Score 5 (High) |
|--------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| Search Volume | 20% | <100/mo | >10,000/mo |
| Keyword Difficulty | 25% | KD >80 (hard) | KD <20 (easy) |
| Business Relevance | 30% | Tangential to offering | Core to offering |
| Search Intent Match | 15% | Informational only | Transactional/commercial |
| Trend Direction | 10% | Declining | Growing |

**Priority Score** = Σ(Factor Weight × Score) / 5

### Priority Categories

| Priority | Score Range | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| P0 — Must Target | 4.0-5.0 | Create content immediately |
| P1 — High Value | 3.0-3.9 | Queue for next content sprint |
| P2 — Opportunity | 2.0-2.9 | Plan for future content calendar |
| P3 — Monitor | 1.0-1.9 | Track but don't prioritize |

## Seasonal Keyword Patterns

### Seasonal Analysis Framework

| Season Trigger | Example Keywords | Planning Lead Time | Content Strategy |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Calendar events | "Black Friday SEO", "New Year marketing plan" | 3-4 months ahead | Publish 6-8 weeks before peak |
| Industry events | "[Conference] takeaways", "Google algorithm update" | 1-2 months / reactive | Pre-plan templates, react quickly |
| Budget cycles | "marketing budget template Q1", "SEO ROI report" | 2-3 months ahead | Target planning season (Oct-Dec) |
| Seasonal demand | "summer marketing ideas", "holiday email campaigns" | 2-3 months ahead | Refresh annually with new data |
